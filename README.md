# Satisfactory Auto Splitters

Automatic load balancing of manifold-style production lines for the rest of us.

This mod adds an Auto Splitter building (currently borrowing the model of the stock Programmable Splitter) that supports different output rates for each output and will auto-balance networks of directly connected Auto Splitters.

See the [mod description](https://ficsit.app/mod/AutoSplittersContinued) at [ficsit.app](https://ficsit.app) for more details.

## Maintenance

This mod and all the associated code is licensed under GPL v3, and the original author is [Steffen MÃ¼thing](https://github.com/smuething). All of the work gone into this mod is his, and my work so far has only been that of a maintainer
and ensuring that the work may endure through Satisfactory updates.

As per license terms, I am required to list out all significant changes made to the software
- Changed the original mod reference to AutoSplittersContinued to allow separate listing on SMR, and updated all BPs accordingly
- Updated the recipe and unlock costs for the splitters

The full original license is available in a sperarate file.

As the maintainer of this mod for the time being, it is not in my plans to make significant improvements to this mod. I'm not in capacity to take on more development workload at the moment, however this may change in the future.
If it were to arise, I would try to fix reported bugs, but I cannot guarantee that fixes will be provided. This mod is available for use again, but support for it may be lacking.

### I'd also like to make clear that I have no plans to support experimental releases of Satisfactory.

If Steffen were to claim ownership again, I will gladly transfer it back to him without much delay.

Steffen's original acknowledgements for his initial work on the mod are listed below.

## Acknowledgements

A big thank you to the makers of [SML](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader), without nothing of this would be possible, and the following two mods in particular:

- [AdvancedLogistics](https://github.com/mircearoata/SatisfactoryAdvancedLogistics) by mircearoata, which helped a lot with the basic setup of making a custom splitter. I also "borrowed" the extracted placeholders assets and the UI widget as well as the number input box. Thank you mircearoata!

- [PowerChecker](https://github.com/marcioHuser/powerchecker-SML3) by MarcioHuser, which was a really good template for setting up the C++ side of the mod. Thank you MarcioHuser!
