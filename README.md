# Satisfactory Auto Splitters

Automatic load balancing of manifold-style production lines for the rest of us.

This mod adds an Auto Splitter building (currently borrowing the model of the stock Programmable Splitter) that supports different output rates for each output and will auto-balance networks of directly connected Auto Splitters.

See the [mod description](https://ficsit.app/mod/9FAMg5ZYKAe8Ua) at [ficsit.app](https://ficsit.app) for more details.

## Acknowledgements

A big thank you to the makers of [SML](https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader), without nothing of this would be possible, and the following two mods in particular:

- [AdvancedLogistics](https://github.com/mircearoata/SatisfactoryAdvancedLogistics) by mircearoata, which helped a lot with the basic setup of making a custom splitter. I also "borrowed" the extracted placeholders assets and the UI widget as well as the number input box. Thank you mircearoata!

- [PowerChecker](https://github.com/marcioHuser/powerchecker-SML3) by MarcioHuser, which was a really good template for setting up the C++ side of the mod. Thank you MarcioHuser!
